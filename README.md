An adaptor that enables user to use Nintendo GameCube controller on Nintendo 3DS consoles. 

The controller(Arduino Nano) reads the states of GC controller then writes them to the 3DS. All buttons on GC controller can be freely remapped to 3DS buttons. Still needs a lot of polishing and cleaning up, but it works.
