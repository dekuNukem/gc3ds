I will post a detailed guide once I get to work on another 3DS, after taking some nice pictures. 

The controller(Arduino Nano) reads the states of GC controller then writes them to the 3DS. All buttons on GC controller can be freely remapped to 3DS buttons. Still needs a some polishing and cleaning up, but it works.
